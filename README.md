# Personal Assistant App
An personal organizer that handles and manages different types of lists, such as a to-do list, a contact list, and a birthday dates list. Users can add and remove items, as well as being able to view the entire list as well.

### Features and Skills
- [Remi Library](https://www.remigui.com/) for [GUI](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/gui.html) - converts Python code into HTML
- Lists are stored in one JSON file
- Custom classes and methods that includes custom error messages

### Future Plans
When I get better at Python programming, I'd like to expand this personal assistant app as practice. Planned features include a groceries list and a list of favorite hobbies, movies, music, etc. I also plan on learning more about Python's GUI module and the Remi Library with a better, attractive-looking interface.
