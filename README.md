# Personal Assistant App
My final project for the [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com) Python course.

### Features
- Easy to use GUI via Remi Library
- Add, remove, and retrieve stored contacts list, birthdays list, and to-do items list
- Custom error messages

### See it in action!
Visit the [repl](https://repl.it/@adriculous/Personal-Assistant-App) to test and play around.

### Future Plans
When I get better at Python programming, I'd like to expand this personal assistant app as practice. Features will include groceries list and a list of favorite hobbies, movies, music, etc. I also plan on learning more about Python's GUI module and the Remi Library.
